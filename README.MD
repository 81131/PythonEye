# About - Project 
The *Python Eye* is an AI model which focuses on identifying Sri Lankan snake species and their venom status. 

# Project Story 
This project was the 2nd Year 1st Semester AI/ML module project. I wanted to make something that really help people. 

Usually in most areas of the worls people has this fear for the reptiles. In Sri Lanka we encounter over 120 snake species. But from them less than 10 snakes can be fatal - or high venomous (Excluding Sea Snakes). 

However due to fear and lack of education people tend to kill these snakes when encountered.

The purpose of this project is raise awareness among people and protect the lives of both snakes and human.

# Current Status
Currently (As 2025 November 15) this project runs on desktop computers if streamlit and torch are installed. 

# Local Installation Instructions
> Coming Soon

# Expected Future Work - Immidiate Attention
1. Crop feature for images - With current application it crops to the center. If the snake is in the corner of the images there is a high possibility of misclassification.
2. Create a web app where user can access the service online.(Storage efficient - But relies on ) 



# Expected Future Works - Long Term
1. Create a snake rescuers contact system along with their phone numbers and covering areas. 
2. Include the detailed descriptions about the snakes and their local names.
